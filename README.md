Development of the deformers went smoothly. We split up who would do which feature deformers out of eye spacing, nose size, forehead size, ear size, and mouth smile. We began with the face deformer from an example in the text. 
For some reason one of the blendshape attributes on the face stopped accepting new blendshape sliders - that's why we have a blendshape1 and blendshape2 attribute. There is also a fairly apparent translation occuring when the mouth and forehead sliders are used. I'm not sure how to fix this.

All blendshape base heads have been completed, and MayaPy was used to create a menu with sliders to manipulate the weights on each blendshape. Translation when weights are changed still exists and is the only error we haven't yet corrected - Caleb is looking into it now.
